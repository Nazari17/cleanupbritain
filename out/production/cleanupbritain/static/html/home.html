					<h3><span class="col_green fw_b">&nbsp;This campaign has one main objective: to find sustainable </span><span class="col_green fw_b">and effective solutions to Britain’s epidemic of litter and fly-tipping.</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span class="col_red fw_b">Of course, that’s easy to say, but very difficult to achieve. &nbsp;In reality, changing the behaviour of the 20 million people in Britain who litter is the only answer.</span></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>There are hundreds of thousands of community-spirited people who pick up litter. &nbsp;In the short term, this is great, but it’s also a bit like mopping-up while the taps are still running…. the litter will just keep coming again and again, forever. &nbsp;Our campaign is about turning the taps off.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span class="col_green fw_b">It’s also about trying to force the government to address the numerous and deep systemic failures in both central and local government.</span></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Two examples of these failures are:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Highways England does an appalling job in cleaning up litter on the motorways. &nbsp;Their bosses at the Department of Transport don’t set them a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for cleaning up litter. &nbsp;In other words, Highways England are not judged on whether they clean up litter or not. &nbsp;Consequently, they do a terrible job, no one in government cares and our motorways continue to look like a dumping ground.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>For some unknown and senseless reason, the responsibility of ‘looking after’ non-motorway roads is split between County Councils and local (usually District) Councils. &nbsp;The former is responsible for cutting grass by the side of the road and the latter for litter-picking. &nbsp;So two different organisations do two different jobs at two different times, the result being litter diced into tiny pieces as no-one has removed it before the verges are cut. &nbsp;No-one takes responsibility.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span class="col_green fw_b">Clean Up Britain will continue to expose these sort of failing and dysfunctional practices. &nbsp;Help us by joining the fight.</span></h3>
